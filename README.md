# My Attempt at an Anime Database (MAAAAD)  

The idea behind MAAAAD is to have an overview of anime that:
- I haven't started yet
- I have started but not yet finished
- I have finished watching


**THIS IS STILL A WIP**


## Dependencies
I'm currently using raylib for graphics stuff and sqlite3 for database stuff.
